# LilysHomework

## Description

Whenever George asks Lily to hang out, she's busy doing homework. George wants to help her finish it faster, but he's in over his head! Can you help George understand Lily's homework so she can hang out with him?

Consider an array of
distinct integers, $arr = [a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]]$. George can swap any two elements of the array any number of times. An array is beautiful if the sum of $|arrr[i] - arr[i - 1]|$ among _0 < 1 < n_ is minimal.

Given the array _arr_, determine and return the minimum number of swaps that should be performed in order to make the array beautiful.

## Returns

- int: the minimum number of swaps required

## Input

- The first line contains a single integer, _n_, the number of elements in _arr_. The second line contains _n_-space separated integers, _arr[i]_.
